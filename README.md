# Sam

I'm a student in New Zealand working on lots of random projects and other things that I feel like working on. I focus more on game dev and may open source a few projects if I feel like it.
Have an awesome day!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering full time and working part time doing Software and Production Engineering.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with motivation and staying motivated.
